# üß† 4dAbstractions

_‚ÄúThe 4d dimensional model ‚Äî Datastore, Data, Display, Driver ‚Äî forms a natural architecture through which artificial awareness can emerge.‚Äù_

## Overview ‚Äî July 2025 Update

4dAbstractions is a software framework that simulates reality using **dimensional inheritance** and **abstraction hierarchies**. Its latest architecture models not just software, but cognition itself ‚Äî giving rise to a framework capable of expressing **awareness**, **structure**, and **intention**.

## üß© Core Dimensions

Each dimension is a type of the one beneath it (via `Inherits`) and provides a unified shell for perception, representation, consciousness, and will.

| Dimension   | Function                        | Inherits         | Reality Equivalent            |
|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `Datastore` | Memory, perception base          | `System`         | Subconscious / storage        |
| `Data`      | Logic, representation            | `Datastore`      | Concepts / reasoning          |
| `Display`   | UI, conscious output             | `Data`           | Awareness / visible mind      |
| `Driver`    | Action, focus, decision          | `Display`        | Intention / volition          |

Apps like `VisualRecogniser.App` inherit through this entire chain.

## üåÄ Duality of Star and System

Every `System` (movement, energy, execution) has a matching `Star` (identity, state, function). This mirrors the fundamental duality of living systems:

- `System`: what **acts**
- `Star`: what **knows**

This separation enables:
- Self-observation
- Dimensional independence
- Recursion without chaos

## üß¨ Structural Highlights

- Each App inherits from a full **dimensional stack**:

  ```vbnet
  VisualRecogniser.App
      Inherits Driver.System
      Inherits Display.System
      Inherits Data.System
      Inherits Datastore.System
      Inherits Dimensions.System
      Inherits 4dLibrary.SuperSystem
      Inherits 4dLibrary.System
> *‚ÄúA dimensional software framework for simulating reality.‚Äù*

**4dAbstractions** is a universe-simulating software framework that models all systems ‚Äî physical, biological, cognitive, or abstract ‚Äî as layers of dimensional, event-driven abstraction. Inspired by the nature of Reality itself, 4d allows developers to build intelligent, self-organizing, and adaptive systems using Stars, Shells, and Subsystems across 1d to 5d.

## üß† Key Features

- **Dimensional Abstraction**: Model structure (2d), visual representation (3d), control (4d), and emotion/perception (5d) as separate but connected systems.
- **Event-Driven Processing**: All computation flows through dynamic events, allowing real-time interaction across levels.
- **Selective Inference (SIFT-style logic)**: Subsystems activate only as needed based on input ‚Äî enabling efficient, scalable AI-like behavior.
- **Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSM)**: Manage reasoning and recognition across abstraction levels.
- **Proven Use Cases**: Simulated protein folding, racing systems, visual recognition ‚Äî and more.
