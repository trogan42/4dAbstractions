# 4dAbstractions

> *“A dimensional software framework for simulating reality.”*

**4dAbstractions** is a universe-simulating software framework that models all systems — physical, biological, cognitive, or abstract — as layers of dimensional, event-driven abstraction. Inspired by the nature of Reality itself, 4d allows developers to build intelligent, self-organizing, and adaptive systems using Stars, Shells, and Subsystems across 1d to 5d.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Dimensional Abstraction**: Model structure (2d), visual representation (3d), control (4d), and emotion/perception (5d) as separate but connected systems.
- **Event-Driven Processing**: All computation flows through dynamic events, allowing real-time interaction across levels.
- **Selective Inference (SIFT-style logic)**: Subsystems activate only as needed based on input — enabling efficient, scalable AI-like behavior.
- **Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSM)**: Manage reasoning and recognition across abstraction levels.
- **Proven Use Cases**: Simulated protein folding, racing systems, visual recognition — and more.
